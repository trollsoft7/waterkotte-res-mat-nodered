Hello,

I used FHEM on a Raspberry Pi to readout my Waterkotte Res端mat CD4 via this
https://wiki.fhem.de/wiki/Waterkotte_heat_pump_with_Res端mat_CD4

Having Home Assistant in use, I tried to integrate it via Node-Red:



The heatpump is connected via USB-Serial-Port Converter

The flow reads out the Res端mat every minute. The set-commands are not yet working.

Use at your own risk!
